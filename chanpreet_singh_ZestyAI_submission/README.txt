Submission By Chanpreet Singh for the role of Assistance Product Manager. 


Notes on Submission:

- Part 1 is submitted is Jupyter NoteBook and a python file is also submitted as an alternative, however running Jupyter Notebook is recommended. The program will take 20-30 min to run and it was taking longer with more accuracy improvement mechanism as mentioned in slides. I have also submitted PDF of Jupyter Notebook for reference as an alternative. Few additional csv files are created to show the unmatched data. 

- Part 2 is submitted as a PDF doc and word file. Two excels are also submitted to see show background work but not cleaned to be submitted to final client. 


Final Note:

Thank you for giving me opportunity to do this exercise and I hope the results are satisfactory, however I could do a lot better by learning from Product Managers in future and am excited to meet them at next interview round.
